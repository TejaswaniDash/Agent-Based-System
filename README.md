# Agent-Based-System

The provided Python code defines an agent-based model (ABM) called "MoneyModel" to simulate the exchange of wealth among a group of agents. In this model, each agent is represented by the "MoneyAgent" class, which has a unique identifier and an initial wealth of 1 unit.

During each step of the simulation, agents interact with each other randomly, transferring wealth. Specifically, if an agent has a positive amount of wealth, it selects another agent randomly and transfers one unit of wealth to that agent while decreasing its own wealth by one unit. This interaction is repeated for a specified number of steps.

The "MoneyModel" class initializes the model by creating a schedule and adding the specified number of agents to it. It provides a method to advance the model by one step, which in turn advances each agent in the model.

The simulation is executed for a specified number of steps, and during each step, the unique identifier and wealth of each agent are printed. This allows for the observation of wealth distribution dynamics and interactions among agents over time.

Agent Class (MoneyAgent):

This class represents an agent in the model.
Each agent has a unique identifier (unique_id) and an initial wealth (wealth) set to 1.
The step() method defines the behavior of the agent:
It prints the agent's unique identifier and wealth.
If the agent's wealth is greater than 0, it randomly selects another agent from the model's schedule and transfers 1 unit of wealth to that agent while decreasing its own wealth by 1.
Model Class (MoneyModel):

This class represents the overall model.
It takes the number of agents (N) as input.
The __init__() method initializes the model by creating a schedule (RandomActivation) and adding agents to it.
The step() method advances the model by one step, which in turn advances each agent in the model.
Initialization and Execution:

An instance of the MoneyModel class (m) is created with 10 agents.
The model is run for 10 steps by calling the step() method 10 times in a loop.
Simulation Execution:

During each step of the simulation, each agent interacts with another randomly chosen agent, transferring wealth if it has any.
Output:

The output of the simulation consists of printed messages indicating the unique identifier and wealth of each agent at each step.
Overall, this code demonstrates a basic agent-based model where agents interact with each other to exchange wealth, with the model advancing in discrete time steps. It's a simplified representation often used for exploring emergent behaviors in complex systems.
